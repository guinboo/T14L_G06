## Problems Encountered & Solutions

Problems Encountered:
- to run the files
- the zombie randomised placement
- the spawning of alien to the middle of the board
- creating a dynamic board.

Solutions:
- open new terminal and copy paste file location and use g++ version.
- using rand() to place the zombies randomly on board based on user input.
- used if else statemement and modulo to place the alien only in middle of board.
- initially tried arrays then later changed it to vector so it becomes a dynamic board instead of a fixed layout board.
